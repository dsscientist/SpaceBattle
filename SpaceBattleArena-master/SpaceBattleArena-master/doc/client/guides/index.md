Welcome Cadet to Space Battle Academy!
========

During your time here, you'll learn about your environment and how your ship behaves.  Space is vast and there's a lot of things which can get you into trouble, but don't worry everything won't be thrown at you at once.

The following guides will help you orient yourself within Space and your Spaceship.  They'll get you oriented with Space, your Ship, and what you may encounter out there in the great beyond.

Use the navigation links in the right-hand box to select your first lesson.
