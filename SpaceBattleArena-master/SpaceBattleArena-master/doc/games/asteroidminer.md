Asteroid Miner [Basic Game]
=============

<a name="overview"></a>Overview
-----------

**Asteroid Miner** is a basic game which is a great way to introduce locating and avoiding objects.

Players must destroy asteroids using torpedoes or by ramming into them with their ships (ouch).  Each asteroid is worth 2 points if destroyed with a torpedo or 1 point if rammed (by default).  These point values can be configured via the Spawn Manager.

Control asteroid spawning and point values by using the standard [Spawn Manager](../server/config.html#spawnmanager) properties.
