 * A command to raise a ship's shields.  Shields will absorb 80% of damage from 
 *   weapons and collisions, protecting a ship's health.  Shields are limited and 
 *   once depleted will disengage and no longer provide protection.  While 
 *   shields are raised, they will be restored at a rate of 4 units per second up 
 *   to the maximum incurring an energy cost of 1 unit per second (in addition to 
 *   the normal energy cost).
 *   <p>
 *   Raising shields is a non-blocking operation.
