/**
 * "King of the Bubble" is a game where there are a number of 'Bubbles' in the world worth some amount of points.
 * <p>
 * By placing your ship within the Bubble, you will absorb its points.
 * <p>
 * When your ship is destroyed, you may drop a new Bubble in the world which represents some amount of the points you have (which are now lost).
 * <p>
 * Multiple ships within the same Bubble will drain it's points faster.  It is also possible to drain points from multiple Bubbles at the same time.
 * <p>
 * Bubbles will eventually start to shrink and disappear on their own.
