 * <ol>
 * 	<li>Client connects to the server</li>
 *  <li>Server requests registration</li>
 *  <li>Client calls {@link #registerShip(int, int, int)} to get registration 
 *  	information and forwards registration to the server</li>
 *  <li>Server responds by sending back an {@link Environment} and waiting for 
 *  	a command</li>
 *  <li>Client calls {@link #getNextCommand(Environment)} and sends the returned 
 *  	command back to the server</li>
 *  <li>Repeat 4-5</li>
 * </ol>
